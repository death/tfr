DESIGN (totally not a hack!)

There are sets of virgin articles, unfinished articles, and finished
(read) articles.

In the beginning (after executing the 'index' command) all the
articles are in the virgin set.

The command 'random' picks an article from the virgin set to view.
The article is moved to the unfinished set.

The command 'next' picks the "oldest" article in the unfinished set to
view.  The article becomes the newest article in the unfinished set.

The command 'finish' moves the most recently viewed article from the
unfinished set to the finished set.
